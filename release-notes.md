Dawn 15.0.1 introduces a few bug fixes.
### Fixes and improvements
- Fix issues where when the header section is hidden, some functionalities were broken.
- Update cart errors to be output as a string rather than a HTML element.
- Escape variant option names so that when an option includes quotation marks it doesnâ€™t cause undesired effects.
- Fix placeholder product cards that were not showing a default price and make the check more robust.
